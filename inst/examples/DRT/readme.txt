This example model simulates growth and horizontal gene transfer in a system
with three groups of bacteria (D: donor, R: recipient, T: transconjugant).

The original model was published as a master's thesis (BRODE, 2015). This
version still has the main features of the original model but some parameters
were added/re-defined. The aim of these modifications was to make parameter
fitting to experimental data more feasible.

The original dose-response function, describing the dependence of the maximum
growth rate in the antibiotic concentration has been replaced by an MIC
(minimum inhibiting concentration) approach.
